AtomPos
--------

Fitting atomic positions in 2D hexagonal materials including defects. We use a Voronoi diagram to represent bonds between nearest neighbors and perform ring statistics. Execute any of the python scripts in the AtomPos directory to run the examples or execute
```
$ ./FitAtomPos tests/graphene_flower_raw.tif  tests/graphene_flower_filtered.tif
```
